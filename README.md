# Turning an A4 PDF into an A5 bound book with PyPDF2

## Introduction
Let's face the truth: I suck when it comes to using a printer. I always get confused when I have to do something special in the GUIs of any existing PDF viewer.

I wanted to print A4 documents so that I could have them as handy, convenient, nicely bound A5 books. So I decided to do some programming to overcome my stupidity.

## The method
This is what you need to do to get A5 ready to bind books from any PDF.
- Put you file in the 'input' folder.
- Run "run.py" and follow the instructions.
- Get you processed PDF from the 'output' folder and print it with these easy settings:
    - Select 2 pages per sheet.
    - Choose to print on both sides (flip on short edge).

Print everything, cut all the sheets by half and bind it. Done!
